# Rainbow-Colors-Facts-Site

The project features an eye-catching website that presents facts about the seven rainbow colors. With a sleek design and interactive components using transform, animation and transitions, it aim to provide an engaging user experience, encouraging visitors to explore and navigate the rainbow colors with curiosity.

This was a project during my internship at Code Tenderloin.

This project was built in glitch and moved to github to better showcase code and project description.
